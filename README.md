Hello sir,
In this assignment after installing npm I don't know why I getting error every time.
here is screenshot of the error message.

So, I tried to find out the solution and then I added

<pre>
"prettier/prettier": [
  "error",
  {
    "endOfLine": "auto",
  }
]
</pre>

inside the rules object of the eslintrc file.Then it worked 1st time and after edit again another error massage appeared.Screenshots of error massage attached bellow.
